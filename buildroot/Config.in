     WAV-file generator tool

     This utility allows simple test WAV files to be generated
     on the target device, and so removes the need to include
     large WAV files in the .itb.

     The wavgen utility can generate:

       * Sawtooth waveforms.
       * Sine-waves.
       * Square-waves.
       * Pink noise.
       * White noise.
       * Counters.
       * Stepped waveforms with known levels.
       * Periodic bursts.
       * Silence.

     The output can also be piped directly to aplay, avoiding
     the need to generate a file on disk.
